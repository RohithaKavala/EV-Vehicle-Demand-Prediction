🚗 EV Vehicle Demand Prediction – Final Project Submission
This project is developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship – July 2025 Batch under the mentorship of RGS-AI. The objective is to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends and predict future EV demand using machine learning techniques. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment using Flask.

📌 Improvisations Done
Integrated Week 1 and Week 2 tasks into a unified final project notebook.

Cleaned and preprocessed raw EV data.

Built and evaluated predictive models for EV demand forecasting.

Deployed model using Flask via app.py.

Added visual elements (image) for better presentation.

Maintained modular structure with well-commented code.
