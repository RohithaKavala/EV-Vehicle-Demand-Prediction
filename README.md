🔋 EV Vehicle Demand Prediction – Final Project
This project is part of the AICTE Virtual Internship (July 2025) under the guidance of RGS-AI. The goal of the project is to predict the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using machine learning techniques.


✅ What I Have Done
Uploaded and explored the EV dataset

Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Built and trained a machine learning model to predict EV demand

Evaluated the model performance

Deployed the model using Flask (app.py)



🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for model building)

Flask (for deployment)

Google Colab (for development)

GitHub (for version control)
