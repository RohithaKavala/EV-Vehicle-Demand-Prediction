🚗 EV Vehicle Demand Prediction – AICTE Virtual Internship Final Project
🔍 Overview
This project aims to predict the demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship (July 2025) under the mentorship of RGS-AI.

🧠 Problem Statement
To analyze EV market trends and forecast EV adoption rates using historical data. The goal is to assist policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure providers with demand-based decisions.

📁 Files Included
Week3_EV_Demand_Prediction.ipynb – Final Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and results.

ev_dataset.csv – Raw dataset used for model development.

preprocessed.csv – Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.

model.pkl – Saved trained ML model.

app.py – Flask-based web application for real-time EV demand prediction.

requirements.txt – Python dependencies required to run the project.

ev_car_factory.jpg – Image used for visualization purposes.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab

Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Flask (for web app)

GitHub (Version control)

✅ Outcome
Successful preprocessing and visualization of EV adoption trends.

Model trained and evaluated to predict demand with high accuracy.

Deployed an interactive web app using Flask.
